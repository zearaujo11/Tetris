# LDTS_1104 - Tetris

## Game Description

-----
Tetris is a game where you have several different shapes called Tetriminos (Square shape, T-shape, S-shape, Z-shape, I-shape, J-shape and L-shape) which move downwards on a vertical grid.
The Tetris game requires players to strategically rotate, move, and drop a procession of Tetriminos that fall into the rectangular Matrix at increasing speeds. Players attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space,
but if the Tetriminos surpass the Ceiling the game is over!
